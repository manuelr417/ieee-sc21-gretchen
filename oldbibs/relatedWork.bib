abstract={In February 2016, World Health Organization declared the Zika outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. With developing evidence it can cause birth defects, and the Summer Olympics coming up in the worst affected country, Brazil, the virus caught fire on social media. In this work, we use Zika as a case study in building a tool for tracking the misinformation around health concerns on Twitter. We collect more than 13 million tweets regarding the Zika outbreak and track rumors outlined by the World Health Organization and Snopes fact checking website. The tool pipeline, which incorporates health professionals, crowdsourcing, and machine learning, allows us to capture health-related rumors around the world, as well as clarification campaigns by reputable health organizations. We discover an extremely bursty behavior of rumor-related topics, and show that, once the questionable topic is detected, it is possible to identify rumor-bearing tweets using automated techniques.},

abstract={An important task of public health officials is to keep track of spreading epidemics, and the locations and speed with which they appear. Furthermore, there is interest in understanding how concerned the population is about a disease outbreak. Twitter can serve as an important data source to provide this information in real time. In this paper, we focus on sentiment classification of Twitter messages to measure the Degree of Concern (DOC) of the Twitter users. In order to achieve this goal, we develop a novel two-step sentiment classification workflow to automatically identify personal tweets and negative tweets. Based on this workflow, we present an
Epidemic Sentiment Monitoring System (ESMOS) that provides tools for visualizing Twitter users’ concern towards different diseases. The visual concern map and chart in ESMOS can help public health officials to identify the progression and peaks of
concern for a disease in space and time, so that appropriate preventive actions can be taken. The DOC measure is based on the sentiment-based classifications. We compare clue-based and different Machine Learning methods to classify sentiments of Twitter users regarding diseases, first into personal and neutral tweets and then into negative from neutral personal tweets. In our experiments, Multinomial Naïve Bayes achieved overall the best results and took significantly less time to build the classifier than other methods.},

 abstract = {Rapid response to a health epidemic is critical to reduce loss of life. Existing methods mostly rely on expensive surveys of hospitals across the country, typically with lag times of one to two weeks for influenza reporting, and even longer for less common diseases. In response, there have been several recently proposed solutions to estimate a population’s health from Internet activity, most notably Google’s Flu Trends service, which correlates search term frequency with influenza statistics reported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). In this paper, we analyze messages posted on the micro-blogging site Twitter.com to determine if a similar correlation can be uncovered. We
propose several methods to identify influenza-related messages and compare a number of regression models to correlate these messages with CDC statistics. Using over 500,000
messages spanning 10 weeks, we find that our best model achieves a correlation of .78 with CDC statistics by leveraging a document classifier to identify relevant messages.},

choices in neighborhoods. In this paper, we analyze Twitter postings of 140 characters or less, known as tweets, to infer user health status over time. Tweets and in turn their users’
health are scored according to semantic analysis, sentiment analysis, emoticon classification, meta-data analysis, and profiling over time. The purpose of the analysis includes
individually targeted healthcare personalization, determining health disparities, discovering health access limitations, advertising, and public health monitoring. The approach is
analyzed on over 12,000 tweets spanning as far back as 2010 for 10 classes of users active on Twitter.},

title={From social media to public health surveillance: Word embedding based clustering method for twitter classification},
abstract={Social media provide a low-cost alternative source for public health surveillance and health-related classification plays an important role to identify useful information. In this paper, we summarized the recent classification methods using social media in public health. These methods rely on bag-ofwords (BOW) model and have difficulty grasping the semantic meaning of texts. Unlike these methods, we present a word embedding based clustering method. Word embedding is one of the strongest trends in Natural Language Processing (NLP) at this moment. It learns the optimal vectors from surrounding words and the vectors can represent the semantic information of words. A tweet can be represented as a few vectors and divided into clusters of similar words. According to similarity measures of all the clusters, the tweet can then be classified as related or unrelated to a topic (e.g., influenza). Our simulations show a good performance and the best accuracy achieved was 87.1%. Moreover, the proposed method is unsupervised. It does not require labor to label training data and can be readily extended to other classification problems or other diseases.},

title={Tracing out various diseases by analyzing Twitter data applying data mining techniques},
abstract={Nowadays, detecting the diseases that are widely spread in the society and predicting the future stages of the diseases has become very important in modern life. Twitter – a
social media platform - a platform used by billions of users around worldwide to express their ideas about various topics, including health conditions. Twitter is used as source for public health information on global scale. To detect the disease andpredict the future spread, social network system (SNS) is helpful. A model has been proposed for predicting the future trend of diseases (cancer) using twitter data. In this paper we built a single linear regression model by using tweets (total number of tweets and tweets related to influenza disease). Live streaming is done for finding the tweets from Forrest Gump website. However when data is incomplete the accuracy of prediction is poor. To improve the accuracy ridge regularization (eliminates the prediction error) is used. The data taken from the twitter is divided into training data and test data and through training data we predict death rates for the test data. When compared to prior studies our model is more accurate for the prediction of death rates.},

 abstract = {Social media is producing massive amounts of data on an unprecedented scale. Here people share their experiences and opinions on various topics, including personal health issues, symptoms, treatments, side-effects, and so on. This makes publicly available social media data an invaluable resource for mining interesting and actionable healthcare insights. In this paper, we describe a novel real-time flu and cancer surveillance system that uses spatial, temporal, and text mining on Twitter data. The real-time analysis results are reported visually in terms of US disease surveillance maps, distribution and timelines of disease types, symptoms, and treatments, in addition to overall disease activity timelines on our project website. Our surveillance system can be very useful not only for early prediction of seasonal disease outbreaks such as flu, but also for monitoring distribution of cancer patients with different cancer types and symptoms in each state and the popularity of treatments used. The resulting insights are expected to help facilitate faster response to and preparation for epidemics and also be very useful for both patients and doctors to make more informed decisions},

abstract={Much attention has been focused on Twitter because it serves as a central hub for the publishing, dissemination, and discovery of online media. This is
true for both traditional news outlets and user generated content, both of which can vary widely in their journalistic and scientific quality. The recent Swine Flu
pandemic of 2009 highlighted this aspect perfectly; global events that created a large online buzz, with some dubious medical facts leaking into public opinion. This
paper presents an investigation into how online resources relating to Swine Flu were discussed on Twitter, with a focus on identifying and analyzing the popularity of trusted information sources (e.g. from quality news outlets and official health agencies). Our findings indicate that reputable sources are more popular than untrusted ones, but that information with poor scientific merit can still leak into to the network and potentially cause harm.},
