\subsection{Paper Organization}
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In section \ref{background} we provide background and motivation material to set the context for the remainder of the paper. In section \ref{archi} our deep learning models that can be used to help predict properties of molecules, using SMILES representations. Our experimental setup and results are presented in section \ref{experiments}. Related works are presented and discussed in section \ref{relwork}. Finally, section \ref{conclude} contains our summary of results, conclusions, and future works.
