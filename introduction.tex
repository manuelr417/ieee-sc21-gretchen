\section{Introduction \label{intro}}
Understanding and predicting physical and chemical properties of molecules is an important tasks for novel drug discovery, materials design, and battery design, particularly in the context of the   development of medical and wearable devices.

\subsection{Contributions}
\subsection{Paper Organization}
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In section \ref{background} we provide background and motivation material to set the context for the remainder of the paper. In section \ref{archi} our deep learning models that can be used to help predict properties of molecules, using SMILES representations. Our experimental setup and results are presented in section \ref{experiments}. Related works are presented and discussed in section \ref{relwork}. Finally, section \ref{conclude} contains our summary of results, conclusions, and future works.
